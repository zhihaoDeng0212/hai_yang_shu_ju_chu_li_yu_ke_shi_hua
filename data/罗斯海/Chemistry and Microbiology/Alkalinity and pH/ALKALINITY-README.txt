Alkalinity 

Alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl at 20 degrees C. Report includes alkalinity, correction factor (if applicable), and pH.

Data File format

	Exp: expedition number
	Site: site number
	Hole: hole number
	Core: core number
	Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).
	Sect: section number
	Top offset (cm): position of the upper edge of the sample, measured relative to the top of the section.
	Bottom offset (cm): position of the lower edge of the sample, measured relative to the top of the section.
	Top depth CSF-A (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Bottom depth CSF-A (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Top depth CSF-B (m): top edge of sample indexed to depth below seafloor on CSF-B scale.
	Bottom depth CSF-B (m): bottom edge of sample indexed to a depth below seafloor via the CSF-B scale.
	Alkalinity (mM): ability of a solution to neutralize acid to the equivalence point of carbonate measured by titration.
	pH (none): aciditiy or basicity of a solution measured by ion-selective electrode.
	Timestamp (UTC): time file was uploaded, which is typically a few minutes to hours after data were acquired.
	Text ID: automatically generated unique database identifier for a sample, visible on printed labels.
