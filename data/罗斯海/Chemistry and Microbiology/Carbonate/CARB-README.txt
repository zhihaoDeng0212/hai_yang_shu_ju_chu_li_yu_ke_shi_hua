Carbonates composite report

This composite report includes data from two analyses (total carbon from "Elemental analysis [CHNS]" and inorganic carbon from "[Coulometer]"). Each row combines the CHNS and Coulometer data from measurements made on the same sample at the same time for a particular section and section offset (depth). If data do not exist for a particular expedition, the column does not appear. To identify individual samples and tests, see each separate data type (Elemental analysis and Coulometer). If the same sample was measured multiple times by any of the methods, results in the report will be combined on one line where possible. Each additional replicate result will be shown in subsequent rows and will be combined where possible. Report includes results for carbon forms: total, inorganic, calcium carbonate, and organic by difference.

Data File format

	Exp: expedition number
	Site: site number
	Hole: hole number
	Core: core number
	Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).
	Sect: section number
	A/W: archive (A) or working (W) section half.
	Top offset on section (cm): position of the upper edge of the sample, measured relative to the top of the section.
	Bot offset on section (cm): position of the lower edge of the sample, measured relative to the top of the section.
	Top depth CSF-A (m): position of observation expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Top depth [other] (m): position of observation expressed relative to the top of the hole. The location is presented in a scale selected by the science party or the report user.
	Inorganic carbon (wt%): direct measurement by coulometry.
	Calcium carbonate (wt%): not stored in LIMS but calculated from IC assuming that all carbonate occurs as calcium carbonate: CaCO3 = IC x 8.33.
	Total carbon (wt%): direct measurement by CHNS analyzer.
	Hydrogen (wt%): direct measurement by CHNS analyzer (total hydrogen).
	Nitrogen (wt%): direct measurement by CHNS analyzer (total nitrogen).
	Sulfur (wt%): direct measurement by CHNS analyzer (total sulfur).
	Organic carbon (wt%) by difference (CHNS-COUL): not stored in LIMS but calculated as the difference between TC and IC values: TOC = TC - IC.
	Organic carbon (wt%), CHNS with treated sample: direct measurement of total organic carbon by CHNS analyzer, after treatment of sample to remove inorganic carbon.
	Sample treatment method (CHNS organic carbon): treatment method (e.g., acidification) used for the CHNS-based organic carbon analysis.
