IW elemental analysis (ICP-AES)

Elemental concentration in interstitial water samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Data are presented by element-wavelength pair (e.g., more than one calcium line may be reported). Elemental lines for which data do not exist for a particular expedition will not appear.

Data File format

	Exp: expedition number
	Site: site number
	Hole: hole number
	Core: core number
	Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).

	Top depth CSF-A (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Bottom depth CSF-A (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Top depth CSF-B (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Bottom depth CSF-B (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Element name: name of element found in the sample.
	Element symbol: chemical symbol of element analyzed.
	Concentration: concentration of element found in sample. See published report for concentration unit information.
	Wavelength (nm): wavelength used to measure concentration of an element found in the sample.
