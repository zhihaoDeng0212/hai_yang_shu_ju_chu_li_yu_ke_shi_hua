Salinity

Salinity was measured on interstitial water (IW) samples using an optical refractometer.

Data File format

	Exp: expedition number
	Site: site number
	Hole: hole number
	Core: core number
	Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).
	Sect: section number
	Top offset (cm): position of the upper edge of a piece, measured relative to the top of a section.
	Bottom offset (cm): position of the lower edge of a piece, measured relative to the top of a section.
	Top depth CSF-A (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Bottom depth CSF-A (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Top depth CSF-B (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
	Bottom depth CSF-B (m): bottom edge of sample indexed to a depth below seafloor via the CSF-B scale.
	Salinity: salinity measured by refractometer (unitless).
	Comments: observer's notes about a measurement, the sample, or the measurement process.
