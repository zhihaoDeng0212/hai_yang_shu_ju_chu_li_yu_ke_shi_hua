IW elemental analysis (ICP-AES)

Elemental concentration in interstitial water samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Data are presented by element-wavelength pair (e.g., more than one calcium line may be reported). Elemental lines for which data do not exist for a particular expedition will not appear.

Data File format

    Exp: expedition number
    Site: site number
    Hole: hole number
    Core: core number
    Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).
    Sect: section number
    Top depth CSF-A (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
    Bottom depth CSF-A (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
    Top depth [other] (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole. The location is presented in a scale selected by the science party or the report user.
    Bottom depth [other] (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole. The location is presented in a scale selected by the science party or the report user.
    Element name: name of element found in the sample.
    Element symbol: chemical symbol of element analyzed.
    Concentration: concentration of element found in sample. See published report for concentration unit information.
    Wavelength (nm): wavelength used to measure concentration of an element found in the sample.
    Excel filename: Excel file of ICP data.
    ICP filename: raw data file.
    Raw data filename: raw data file.
    Timestamp (UTC): time file was uploaded, which is typically a few minutes to hours after data were acquired.
    Text ID: automatically generated unique database identifier for a sample, visible on printed labels.
    Test No: unique number associated with the instrument measurement steps that produced these data. 
    Sample comments: observations recorded about the sample itself.
    Test comments: observations about a measurement or the measurement process; some measurement observations may be under Result comments.
    Result comments: observations about a measurement or the measurement process; some measurement observations may be under Test comments.
