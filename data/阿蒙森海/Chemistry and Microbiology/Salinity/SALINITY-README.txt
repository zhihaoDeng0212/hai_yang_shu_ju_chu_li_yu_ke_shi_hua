Salinity

Salinity was measured on interstitial water (IW) samples using an optical refractometer.

Data File format

    Exp: expedition number
    Site: site number
    Hole: hole number
    Core: core number
    Type: type indicates the coring tool used to recover the core (typical types are F, H, R, X).
    Sect: section number
    Top offset (cm): position of the upper edge of a piece, measured relative to the top of a section.
    Bottom offset (cm): position of the lower edge of a piece, measured relative to the top of a section.
    Top depth CSF-A (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
    Bottom depth CSF-A (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole.
    Top depth [other] (m): location of the upper edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole. The location is presented in a scale selected by the science party or the report user.
    Bottom depth [other] (m): location of the lower edge of the sample expressed relative to the top of the hole. The location is presented in a scale selected by the science party or the report user.
    Salinity: salinity measured by refractometer (unitless).
    Timestamp (UTC): time file was uploaded, which is typically a few minutes to hours after data were acquired.
    Text ID: automatically generated unique database identifier for a sample, visible on printed labels.
    Test No: unique number associated with the instrument measurement steps that produced these data. 
    Sample comments: observations recorded about the sample itself.
    Test comments: observations about a measurement or the measurement process; some measurement observations may be under Result comments.
    Result comments: observations about a measurement or the measurement process; some measurement observations may be under Test comments.
